we are able to successfully trigger round 2 after simulated success
in GameFunctions.js lines 83-85.

the problem is when the countdown unmounts, it somehow triggers the
game over view in line 73 GameFunctions.js

1) The countdown should reset after a successful pose within a round
2) There should be some sort of flicker if a pose is the same as the one before

3) There should be some sort of indicator that the round was successful, and we're moving onto the next round
4) Hook up the camera
