            <p class="step-title">Step Number One</p>
            <p>Shift your weight slightly onto the left foot, keeping the inner foot firm to the floor, and bend your right knee. Reach down with your right hand and clasp your right ankle.</p>

            <p class="step-number">2</p>

            <p>Draw your right foot up and place the sole against the inner left thigh; if possible, press the right heel into the inner left groin, toes pointing toward the floor. The center of your pelvis should be directly over the left foot.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="step">

            <p class="step-number">1</p>
            <p class="step-title">Step Number One</p>
            <p>Stand with the bases of your big toes touching, heels slightly apart (so that your second toes are parallel). Lift and spread your toes and the balls of your feet, then lay them softly down on the floor. Rock back and forth and side to side. Gradually reduce this swaying to a standstill, with your weight balanced evenly on the feet.

            <p class="step-title">Step Number Two</p>
            <p>Firm your thigh muscles and lift the knee caps, without hardening your lower belly. Lift the inner ankles to strengthen the inner arches, then imagine a line of energy all the way up along your inner thighs to your groins, and from there through the core of your torso, neck, and head, and out through the crown of your head. Turn the upper thighs slightly inward. Lengthen your tailbone toward the floor and lift the pubis toward the navel.</p>

            <p class="step-number">3</p>
            <p class="step-title">Step Number Three</p>
            <p>Press your shoulder blades into your back, then widen them across and release them down your back. Without pushing your lower front ribs forward, lift the top of your sternum straight toward the ceiling. Widen your collarbones. Hang your arms beside the torso.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <p class="step-number">4</p>
            <p class="step-title">Step Number Four</p>
            <p>Balance the crown of your head directly over the center of your pelvis, with the underside of your chin parallel to the floor, throat soft, and the tongue wide and flat on the floor of your mouth. Soften your eyes.</p>

            <p>Press your elbows against your inner knees, bringing your palms to together, and resist the knees into the elbows. This will help lengthen your front torso.</p>
