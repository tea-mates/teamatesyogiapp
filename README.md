With “Yog-I Says” you can have your own personal coach analysing your pose and telling you how close you are to a perfect pose. It uses TensorFlow's PoseNet model to detect your body joints’ placement. We feed that data into our algorithm to tell you how close you were to a perfect pose. The website for “Yog-I Says” is a single page application using React and Redux.
